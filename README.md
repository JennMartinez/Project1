#Project Title
Gay/Lesbian Dating App (working title)

#Team Members
Jenn Martinez, Michael Navid, Sergio Di Martino

#Project Description
We seek to create a dating app that caters specifically to Gay and Lesbian people looking for long-term relationships. The app will utlize the Tinder API, customized to eliminate various issues that plague the Gay/Lesbian community when using a dating app that is not customized to their experience.

It will also utilize the VisionSync Dating API so that when people have found someone they are interested in, they can then meet online using video to ensure the safety of both persons.
